## Application Description and How To Use
This project is a web application to record user transactions that occur under different categories of spending. The purpose of this project was to create a full stack web application utilizing a front end framework `React`, a back-end framework `Express` and a database `MongoDB` to create, read, update, and delete user transactions and also show budget data based on these recorded transactions.

A registration feature was also added to the application. The user must register and be logged in to post new transactions.

After logging in the user presses the `New Transaction` button to post an item or service they paid for and it is saved into the database and displayed on the interface with the name, category, and cost.
